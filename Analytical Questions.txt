Analytical Qestions:

Q 1:  Create the CSV files according to the provided database schema, ensuring that all constraints and relationships among tables are properly reflected, and then import them into pgAdmin ? (If you prefer using a different RDBMS, ensure to adjust the syntax accordingly throughout the queries)

Q 2: From the tables you created find, for each venue, the average number of runs scored per match (total of both teams) in the stadium? 
In order to calculate total run, you must sum runs_scored & extra_runs from ball_by_ball table.

Q 3: Find players who faced the maximum number of balls per match on average and limit your answer to the top 10? 
A batsman faced a ball if there is an entry in ball_by_ball with that player as the striker.

Q 4: Find players who are the most frequent six hitters? 
that is, players who hit a 6 in the highest fraction of balls that they face. Output the player id, player name, the number of times the player has got 6 runs in a ball, the number of balls faced, and the fraction of 6s.

Q 5: Find top 3 batsmen and top 3 bowlers player_ids who got highest no of runs and highest no of wickets respectively in each season?
Output (season_year, batsman, runs, bowler, wickets). Here batsman & bowler are player_ids of the players. Incase of ties output the player with lesser player_id first. Order by season_year (earlier year comes first) and rank(batsman and bowler with more no of runs and wickets in a particular season comes first). There will be (no_of_seasons*3) rows.

Q 6: Write an SQL query to find the IDs of players who achieved the highest number of partnership runs for each match? The output should include (match_id, player1, runs1, player2, runs2), sorted in descending order of partnership runs. In case of ties, the match_id should be sorted in ascending order. Ensure that runs1 is greater than runs2 in every row, and if runs1 equals runs2, then player1_id should be greater than player2_id. Note that extra_runs should not be included in the count. There can be multiple rows for each match if different players achieve equal partnership runs multiple times.

Q 7: For all the matches with win type as wickets, find the over ids in which the runs scored are less than 6 runs? Output (match_id, innings_no, over_id). Note : Runs scored in an over also include the extra_runs.

Q 8: List top 5 batsmen by number of sixes hit in the season 2013 ? 
Output (player_name).

Q 9: List 5 bowlers by lowest strike rate(average number of balls bowled per wicket taken) in the season 2013? Break ties alphabetically. Output (player_name).

Q 10: For each country(with at least one player bowled out) find out the number of its players who were bowled out in any match? Output (country_name, count). Here the country is the home country of the player.

Q 11: List the names of right- handed players who have scored at least a century in any match played in 'Pune' ? Order the output alphabetically on player_name. Output (player_name, run).
